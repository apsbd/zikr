# Session Notes - Offline Study Fix

## Current Issue
- Study page not accessible when offline (shows static offline page instead)
- Due counts not updating properly when studying cards
- Need to implement true offline-first study functionality

## Requirements
1. Study page must work completely offline
2. All study data should be available from IndexedDB
3. Due counts should update in real-time after studying
4. No static offline page should show for study routes

## Implementation Plan
1. Fix service worker to properly cache study routes
2. Ensure study page can render from IndexedDB data
3. Fix due count updates after studying cards
4. Test offline functionality thoroughly

## Technical Details
- Using offline-first strategy with IndexedDB
- Study page is dynamic but all data is available locally
- Need to update caching strategy for dynamic routes
