# Session Notes - Offline-First Manual Sync Implementation

## Overview
Implemented explicit manual sync functionality for the Zikr app to create a true offline-first experience where users have full control over when data syncs happen.

## Issues Fixed ✅
- Study page not accessible when offline ✅ FIXED
- Due counts not updating properly when studying cards ✅ FIXED
- Daily limit not working correctly (showing 20 new cards every session) ✅ FIXED
- Auto-update mechanism causing infinite reload loops ✅ FIXED
- Auth tokens being cleared during cache updates ✅ FIXED

## Manual Sync Implementation ✅

### 1. **Sync Dialog Component** (`src/components/SyncDialog.tsx`)
   - Upload Progress: Sends local data to server (overwrites server data)
   - Download Progress: Downloads server data to local (overwrites local data)
   - Clear warning dialogs for both operations
   - Progress indicators and status messages

### 2. **Manual Sync Methods** (`src/lib/offline/sync-engine.ts`)
   - `performUploadSync()`: Uploads all local user progress to server
   - `performDownloadSync()`: Downloads all server progress to local
   - Both methods handle conflicts by complete overwrite (user's choice)

### 3. **Disabled Automatic Sync**
   - Removed automatic sync from login/logout
   - Disabled sync on network status changes
   - Removed periodic background sync
   - Removed sync triggers from data operations (create, update, delete)
   - Updated auth context to not sync on sign in/sign up

### 4. **Dashboard Integration**
   - Added "Sync Progress" button in dashboard
   - Sync dialog opens on button click
   - Dashboard reloads after successful sync

## Architecture Changes
- True offline-first: App works entirely offline after initial load
- Manual sync only: Users explicitly choose when to sync
- No automatic background operations
- Clear data ownership: Users decide which data source is authoritative

## Testing Instructions
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start: `npm start`
3. Study some cards offline
4. Click "Sync Progress" button
5. Choose to upload (local → server) or download (server → local)
6. Verify data syncs correctly in chosen direction
