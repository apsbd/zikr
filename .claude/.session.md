# Session Notes - Pure IndexedDB Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a pure IndexedDB-based solution for the Zikr app with no caching, real-time calculations, and explicit manual sync.

## Key Implementation Details âœ…

### 1. **Pure IndexedDB Storage**
   - All data stored exclusively in IndexedDB
   - No caching mechanisms - removed service worker caching
   - Real-time calculation of deck statistics from IndexedDB
   - Study page loads all data from IndexedDB

### 2. **Manual Sync Implementation**
   - **Download Sync**: Downloads ALL data (decks, cards, progress) from server
   - **Upload Sync**: Uploads local progress to server
   - Clear warnings for data overwriting
   - No automatic sync anywhere in the app

### 3. **Study Page Behavior**
   - Shows loading state for any deck ID
   - Displays helpful message if deck not synced yet
   - Loads all card data from IndexedDB in real-time
   - No network requests or caching

### 4. **Architecture Changes**
   - Removed all service worker caching
   - Deck stats calculated real-time on every render
   - All data operations go through IndexedDB only
   - No real-time data fetching from server

## Data Flow
1. User must explicitly sync data using "Sync Progress" button
2. Download sync loads ALL decks, cards, and progress into IndexedDB
3. Study page reads directly from IndexedDB
4. Deck statistics calculated fresh from IndexedDB on each page load
5. No automatic syncing or background operations

## Testing Instructions
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start: `npm start`
3. Click "Sync Progress" and download data
4. Navigate to any study page URL - will show loading then data
5. Study offline - all data comes from IndexedDB
6. Verify deck stats update in real-time as you study
