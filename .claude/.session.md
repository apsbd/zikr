# Session Notes - Offline Study Fix

## Issues Fixed ✅
- Study page not accessible when offline (shows static offline page instead) ✅ FIXED
- Due counts not updating properly when studying cards ✅ FIXED

## Implementation Completed
1. **Due Count Updates**
   - Added 500ms delay in `handleReturnToDashboard` to ensure database writes complete
   - Added timestamp query parameter to force dashboard refresh
   - Added debounced loading in dashboard to prevent race conditions

2. **Offline Study Page Access**
   - Created `simple-offline-sw.js` with simplified caching strategy
   - Caches study pages when visited online using pathname-based keys
   - Multiple fallback strategies for offline access
   - Properly handles Next.js App Router dynamic pages

## Final Solution Details
- Service worker caches HTML responses with pathname as key for consistency
- Cache version: `study-pages-v3`
- Fallback order when offline:
  1. Try pathname-based cache key
  2. Try original request
  3. Try any cached study page
  4. Last resort: offline.html

## Testing Instructions
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Start: `npm start`
3. Visit study page online to cache it
4. Go offline (airplane mode)
5. Refresh study page - should load from cache
6. Study cards and return - due count updates correctly
